                <a href="index.html" class="text-body">
                    <p class="h5">By: Grace Fling</p>
                </a>
                <p>In the United States, wealth inequality is higher than almost every other country. Many financial
                    crises such as the COVID-19 recession and the 2008 financial crisis have only increased wealth
                    inequality. This inequalty has created a hot debate nationally.</p>
                <p>Wealth inequality in the US is the unequal distribution of assests among US citizens. 77% of the
                    wealth in the US belongs to the top 10% of Americans. The bottom 50% of Americans only own 1% of the
                    wealth in the US.</p>
                <p>There are multiple causes of this inequality,
                    that affect a number of life aspects. In this article, I will be focusing on 3 major implications:
                    social, economic, and political.
                </p>

                <p class="h3">Social Implications</p>
                <p>text</p>

                <p class="h3">Economic Implications</p>
                <p>text</p>
                <p>61% of Americans say there is too much economic inequality. Ineqaulity was a major topic of
                    discussion among the 2020 Demoractic primary. Some of the proposals supported by democratic
                    candidates gauranteed a general basic income, supported taxing corporations and the wealthy more,
                    and raising federal minimum wage.</p>

                <p class="h3">Political Implications</p>
                <p>As wealth inequality continues to grow, one of the main political concerns is the middle class
                    dissapearing. This potentially poses a threat to democracy. Democracy includes freedom, equality,
                    and autonomy. In a democracy, individuals are equal before the law, have equal influence on
                    government, etc. So if the rich and the poor are equal under government, then why does money have to
                    sway political standing and equality? The less equal the society, there will likely be a demand of
                    democratization.</p>
                <p>Different political parties views on this differ dramatically. Majority of democrats in all income
                    groups agree there is too much wealth inequality. Republicans on the other hand are more likely than
                    Democrats to say there is the right amount of wealth inequality in the US. Interestingly, low-income
                    Republicans are more likely to say there is too much wealth inequality, while high-income
                    Republicans are more likely to say there is the right amount.</p>
                <p>Either way, 61% of Americans agree there is too much wealth inequality in our nation. While most
                    Democrats argue there needs to be major changes to fix this issue, most Republicans argue there are
                    only minor chnages neccessary. Considering that over half of Americans agree there is too much
                    wealth inequality, it is important to make long-term plans that can lessen wealth inequality and
                    protext against furture financial crises that greatly impact wealth inequality.</p>
