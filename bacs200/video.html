                        <p class="card-text">Hi! My name is Grace Fling, I'm twenty years old and I am a third year
                            student at the University of Northern Colorado. I am currently studying Business
                            Administration with an emphasis in marketing and a minor in digital marketing.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title">Background</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Growing up, none of my siblings went to college, so when I had the
                            opportunity to go to college I really took advantage of advancing my educational career.
                            Initially, it was hard for me to decide a major, but my father who works in IT and my
                            mother
                            who is a nurse, both encouraged me to explore business. I'm really glad I took that
                            step,
                            because now I couldn't see myself studying in any other field. Having taken classes such
                            as
                            social media marketing, web design and development, and consumer behavior has helped me
                            discover my goal of one day becoming a social media marketing manager.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title">Greatest Skills</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">My greatest skills that would help me succeed in a social media
                            marketing
                            role include: excellent communication, creativity, analytical skills, marketing
                            knowledge,
                            and adaptability.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Communication is critical to represent an organization and interact with
                            customers, as well as communicate with colleagues. Having taken 3 different
                            communications
                            courses thus far, I feel well versed in both internal and external communications that
                            can
                            make me successful in putting ideas and campaigns into words.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I have always considered creativity one of my strongest skills, and have had the
                            opportunity
                            ot grow my creativity through my college education. In my social media marketing class,
                            students used a simulation that allowed us to develop organic content posts, paid
                            promotion
                            posts, and influencer media. This simulation taught me how to incorportate creativity
                            into
                            marketing through consistently coming up with new and engaging ideas, creative
                            initiatives,
                            and campaigns.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>After taking multiple personality tests, the one result I always got back was that I am
                            an
                            analytical thinker. I recognized my skill for analytics in my consumer behavior class
                            where
                            I wrote an article, conducted an A/B test to determine the best title graphic, and then
                            published,
                            promoted, and tracked its engagement, traffic, and views.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>From the moment I took my first marketing class, I knew this was going to be something I
                            invested myself in. Through multiple markeitn classes I ahve developed a wide
                            understanding
                            of marketing principled and how they can be applied to social media and digital
                            marketing.
                            This includes things such as ways to increase SEO, content marketing through blogs and
                            videos, and more.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Lastly, I am extremely adaptable. As technology and social platforms continue to advance,
                            the
                            need for flexability and adaptability rise. Change is a constant in social media and I
                            can
                            quickly adapt to new situations that arise, whether good or bad.</p>
                        <h5 class="card-title">Personal Value Offered</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">What I can offer to a prospective company is implementing the skills listed

                            compiling campaigns and creating content. I will be able to support the devlopment of brand
