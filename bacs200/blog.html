                <p>In the United States, wealth inequality is higher than almost every other country. Many financial
                    crises such as the COVID-19 recession and the 2008 financial crisis have only increased wealth
                    inequality. This inequalty has created a hot debate nationally.</p>
                <p>Wealth inequality in the US is the unequal distribution of assests among US citizens. 77% of the
                    wealth in the US belongs to the top 10% of Americans. The bottom 50% of Americans only own 1% of the
                    wealth in the US.</p>
                <p>There are multiple causes of this inequality,
                    that affect a number of life aspects. In this article, I will be focusing on 3 major implications:
                    social, economic, and political.
