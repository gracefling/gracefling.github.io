    <h1>My Hero</h1>
    <p>My hero is Blake Lively</p>
    <p>Blake Lively inspires me because not only does she promote women empowerment, but is also an advocate in raising awareness on the global crisis of childhood sexual abuse and exploitation.</p>
    <p>Blake has Blake has held meetings and events with Child Rescue Coalition and a leading internet service provider as well as Facebook to discuss ways that the tech and communication organizations can develop tools that make the internet a safer place.</p>
    <p>The work Blake Lively has done to fight child pornography is extremely admirable. Although many problems that surround the world are discussed, I believe child pornography can often be overlooked by many. It is a very prevalent and pressing issue that needs help to presecute and convict child predators.</p>
    <p>It is amazing to see the hard work and attention Blake Lively brings to this issue, and how she uses her social influence to direct matters that are important in the world and important to her.</p>
