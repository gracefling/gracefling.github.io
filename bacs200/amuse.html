        <h2>BuzzFeed Quizzes</h2>
        <p>BuzzFeed has great content to begin with, but the quizzes they have are very funny. Have you ever wondered what your favorite breakfast sandwich says about you? A BuzzFeed quiz can tell you.</p>

        <h2>Cat Bounce</h2>
        <p>Cat Bounce is one of my favorite sites to visit when I need a pick-me-up. Who doesn't enjoy seeing cats bounce across their screen?</p>
