                <a href="index.html" class="text-body">
                    <p class="h5">By: Grace Fling</p>
                </a>
                <p>In the United States, wealth inequality is higher than almost every other country. Many financial
                    crises such as the COVID-19 recession and the 2008 financial crisis have only increased wealth
                    inequality. This inequalty has created a hot debate nationally.</p>
                <p>Wealth inequality in the US is the unequal distribution of assests among US citizens. 77% of the
                    wealth in the US belongs to the top 10% of Americans. The bottom 50% of Americans only own 1% of the
                    wealth in the US.</p>
                <p>There are multiple causes of this inequality,
                    that affect a number of life aspects. In this article, I will be focusing on 3 major implications:
                    social, economic, and political. It is important to understand both sides of this debate to fully
                    recognize the need to decrease wealth inequality.
                </p>

                <p class="h3">Social Implications</p>
                <p>Many social impacts arrise from wealth inequality, that tend to affect lower-income individuals far
                    more than rich individuals. Much like a science experiment, wealth inequality is the independent
                    variable and social implications are the dependent varaiable.</p>
                <p>Due to a lack of wealth, many low income individuals tend to experince more mental illness, lower
                    life expectancy, higher infant mortality, more obesity, more teen births, and more. Conversely,
                    people with high wealth do not face these issues as much because their wealth allows them more
                    opportunities. More wealth means better jobs, education, health care, etc. In turn, these
                    opportunities allow for rich individuals and families to never face a lot of the hardships low
                    income families do.</p>
                <p>If wealth inequality were to lessen, then many of the social factors mentioned prior, would decrease.
                    Another benefit would be improved educational performance and access. Overall, this would create an
                    equal opportunity for any individual to be affected by these social impacts, and not just target
                    people who don't have an equal amount of wealth.</p>

                <p class="h3">Economic Implications</p>
                <p>Wealth inequality shifts a large share of income to rich households who tend to save their money
                    rather than spend it. Due to this, there is a lack of aggregate demand because the people who have
                    money to spend are saving it, and the people without money can't spend it.</p>
                <p>In the past, wealth inequality has been compensated through methods such as lowering interest rates.
                    These methods are not likely to last which means more permamnetn fixes need to be put in place.</p>
                <p>Some of the proposals put forward in recent years aim to gauranteed a general basic income, support
                    taxing corporations and the wealthy at a higher rate,
                    and raising federal minimum wage. An additional tool for addressing this inequality is increasing
                    education access for both college and early education.</p>

                <p class="h3">Political Implications</p>
                <p>As wealth inequality continues to grow, one of the main political concerns is the middle class
                    dissapearing. This potentially poses a threat to democracy. Democracy includes freedom, equality,
                    and autonomy. In a democracy, individuals are equal before the law, have equal influence on
                    government, etc. So if the rich and the poor are equal under government, then why does money have to
                    sway political standing and equality? The less equal the society, there will likely be a demand of
                    democratization.</p>
                <p>Different political parties views on this differ dramatically. Majority of democrats in all income
                    groups agree there is too much wealth inequality. Republicans on the other hand are more likely than
                    Democrats to say there is the right amount of wealth inequality in the US. Interestingly, low-income
                    Republicans are more likely to say there is too much wealth inequality, while high-income
                    Republicans are more likely to say there is the right amount.</p>
                <p>Either way, 61% of Americans agree there is too much wealth inequality in our nation. While most
                    Democrats argue there needs to be major changes to fix this issue, most Republicans argue there are
                    only minor chnages neccessary. Considering that over half of Americans agree there is too much
                    wealth inequality, it is important to make long-term plans that can lessen wealth inequality and
                    protect against furture financial crises that greatly impact wealth inequality.</p>

                <p class="h3">Conclusion</p>
                <p>By demonstrating the social, economic, and political effects of wealth inequality it is easy to see
                    that it is an extremely large inssue in the United States. Majority of the nation is negatively
                    impacted by wealth inequality and is fighting for fairness to combat this long-time issue.</p>
                <p>It is important to note that although wealth may not ever be completely equal among US citizens,
                    decreasing the gap even a little bit would have a profound impact on the lives of Americans. It is
                    crucial to begin working towards closing the wealth inequality gap to increase access to education,
                    improve health, and be prepared for future financial crises.</p>
